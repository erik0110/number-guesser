# Number Guesser #

Number Guesser is a one player game where you have to guess a random number from 1-100. There's no winning or losing, just trying beat your best score.

This game's structure was created using HTML. It was relatively basic considering there wasn't too much content. The presentation was replicated from a comp, using CSS. There's s few different fonts, colors, and buttons. Finally, the game came all together by including a user interaction, which was done with JavaScript. The buttons are functional, the page is responsive, and it does the job.

The game could have gone further in depth, allowing a player to level-up, or even a battle between 2 players. Unfortunately the JavaScript portion took up a bit more time than I expected. Overall though, I'm very pleased with my first major project.
